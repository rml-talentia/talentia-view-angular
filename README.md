## Restore old shell

Because everything is not implemented, sometime it can be useful to switch to the old shell.

In this case, in file talentia-accounting/applications/iris.ear/iris.war/dashboard.shell.jsp , search the next line

```java
boolean newDashboard = true;
```

Switch the value to of newDashboard to false.
